# Loan Default Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of loan default risks. The objective of this project is to assess factors contributing to loan defaults by transforming and analyzing a complex dataset with a significant number of missing numerical values. Through thoughtful data processing and feature engineering, the dataset was prepared for meaningful analysis despite the initial limitations.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values:** Addressing the large proportion of missing numerical values was crucial in this analysis. The challenge required careful consideration to ensure that the missing data was handled effectively without losing valuable insights.
  
- **Feature Engineering:** By creatively transforming existing variables and categorizing data, new features were constructed to add depth to the analysis, making the dataset more robust and suitable for predictive modeling.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Initial steps involved addressing the high number of missing values. This process included imputation techniques and data transformation to ensure the dataset reached a level of completeness required for analysis. The categorization of features played a significant role in enhancing the dataset's overall quality.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA was performed to uncover patterns in loan default behavior. This involved visualizing key variables and exploring correlations to identify the primary factors influencing default risk.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python (Pandas)** for data transformation, analysis, and handling missing values
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
- **GitHub** for version control

## Key Findings
Despite initial data quality concerns, through thoughtful data processing and feature transformation, the analysis was able to provide key insights into the factors influencing loan defaults.

Through effective data processing and feature transformation, the analysis revealed two major factors influencing loan defaults. The strongest predictor of loan default was found to be the number of children a borrower has, with the majority of default cases coming from individuals with three or more children. Additionally, the purpose of the loan played a significant role, as many defaults were linked to loans taken out for vehicle-related purposes, such as car repairs or purchases.


## Conclusion
Effective data transformation and feature engineering enabled a robust analysis of loan default risks, despite the dataset's initial limitations. This approach highlights the importance of creative problem-solving in data analysis, where handling missing values can unlock meaningful insights.
